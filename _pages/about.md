<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a researcher at at <a href='https://www.shlab.org.cn/'>Shanghai AI Laboratory</a> (shlab). I received my Ph.D. degree through a Joint PhD Program between <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/'>Microsoft Research Asia</a> (MSRA) and <a href='https://en.ustc.edu.cn/'>University of Science and Technology of China</a> (USTC) in 2022. Prior to that, I received my Bachelor degree of Engineering at University of Science and Technology of China in 2017. I joined the Shanghai AI Laboratory in July 2022.

My research interest includes 2D generation and 3D reconstrution/generation. I am also now working on open-world detection and domain adaptation/genelization. 

We are seeking long-term internship candidates and looking for research collaboration. Please send email to me if you want to join us.
